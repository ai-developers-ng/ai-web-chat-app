# SSL Validation Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem
SSL validation error for sts.amazonaws.com when trying to login or use AWS services

## Root Cause
SSL certificate validation failures can occur due to:
1. Outdated certificate bundles
2. Missing root certificates
3. Network/firewall issues
4. System clock problems
5. Python SSL configuration issues

## Solutions

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. Run the SSL fix script:
   ```bash
   cd ai-web-chat-app
   python fix_ssl_issue.py
   ```

2. Restart your Flask application:
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```

### Manual Fix
1. Upgrade certifi and SSL-related packages:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade certifi urllib3 requests pyopenssl
   ```

2. Set environment variable to use certifi certificates:
   ```bash
   export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
   ```

3. Restart the application

### Alternative Solutions

#### Disable SSL Verification (Development Only)
Add this to your Python code (not recommended for production):
```python
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```

#### Check System Clock
Ensure your system clock is accurate as SSL validation depends on it.

#### Network Issues
Check firewall or proxy settings that might interfere with SSL connections.

### Testing the Fix
1. Test SSL connectivity with Python:
   ```bash
   python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://sts.amazonaws.com').status_code)"
   ```

2. Expected output:
   ```
   200
   ```

### Support
If issues persist after trying these solutions:
1. Check application and system logs
2. Verify Python environment and SSL configuration
3. Test with a fresh virtual environment
4. Contact support with error logs

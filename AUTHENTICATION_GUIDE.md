## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/check` - Check authentication status
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

- `POST /api/analyze-image` - Image analyzer

## üîß Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses SQLite by default. The database file `ai_web_app.db` is created automatically in the backend directory.

To use a different database, update the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in `backend/config.py`:

```python
# For PostgreSQL
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://user:password@localhost/ai_web_app'

# For MySQL
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://user:password@localhost/ai_web_app'
```

### CORS Configuration
The application is configured to accept requests from:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://127.0.0.1:3000
- http://localhost:5000
- http://127.0.0.1:5000

Update the CORS origins in `backend/app.py` if needed.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Database not found" Error
Run the database initialization script:
```bash
cd backend
python init_db.py
```

#### "Authentication required" Error
Make sure you're logged in. The application will redirect you to login if your session expires.

#### "CORS Error" in Browser
Check that the frontend is running on the correct port and that CORS is configured properly in the backend.

### Logs and Debugging
- Backend logs are displayed in the terminal where you started the server
- Check the browser's developer console for frontend errors
- Database errors are logged to the backend console

## üìà Usage Statistics

The application tracks comprehensive usage statistics:
- Total searches by type
- Total user actions by type
- Login success/failure rates
- Response times for AI queries
- User activity patterns

Access statistics through the History tab ‚Üí Statistics section.

## üîÑ Data Migration

If you need to migrate data or reset the database:

1. **Backup existing data**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/ai_web_app.db backend/ai_web_app.db.backup
   ```

2. **Reset database**:
   ```bash
   rm backend/ai_web_app.db
   cd backend
   python init_db.py
   ```

3. **Restore from backup** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp backend/ai_web_app.db.backup backend/ai_web_app.db
   ```

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to the authentication system:
1. Follow the existing code patterns
2. Add appropriate logging for new features
3. Update this documentation
4. Test authentication flows thoroughly
5. Ensure proper input validation

## üìû Support

For issues related to authentication or logging:
1. Check this guide first
